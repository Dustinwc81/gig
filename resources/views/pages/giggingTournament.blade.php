                    That was how the gigging tournament
                    was born.  Back in
                    April of 1972, John Ward and Matt Mathews went gigging on Spavinaw Creek near Low Water bridge
                    outside Jay, Oklahoma.  They had killed enough fish to eat and were sitting around eating what they
                    had caught and enjoying some Old Charter when John Ward suggested having a gigging tournament like
                    bass fishermen had.  They originally thought about having it on two lakes (Lake Eucha & Spavinaw)
                    on alternating nights, but soon realized that would be too difficult.  So they eventually settled
                    on having it at Lake Eucha.

                    They began organizing the tournament and planned on having it the month of April because that’s when
                    fish were the most plentiful in the creeks..  The early tournaments did not have a preset date but
                    they would choose the date by avoiding Easter and the full moon.  Today’s tournaments are held on the
                    second weekend of April every year so people can plan ahead.  They gathered prizes for the winners and
                    decided on placing 1st-10th and big fish.  Scoring would be 5 points per pound for Redhorse, 4 points
                    per pound for Suckers, 3 points per pound for White Bass, and 1 point per pound for Carp, Perch,
                    Flathead, etc.  It is the same scoring format that is still used today.  Throughout the years they
                    gave fun prizes like smallest fish and the attaboy award for 11th place, but these changed slightly
                    each year.  They also had a Golden Gig award for people who went above

                    They consulted with Joe Hutchison who was the local Game Warden to make sure everything they were
                    doing was legal.  John and Matt funded the tournament themselves for the first two years.  They sold
                    t-shirts, jackets, patches, and ran a concession stand at the tournament to help raise money.  As it
                    continued to grow a board of directors was voted on and The National Green Country Giggers Association
                    was established.  The first year did not have an auspicious beginning.  It rained and the weather was
                    not great for gigging.  The take off was scheduled for 9:00 and at 7:15 only about 6 teams were signed
                    up and ready to go.  John and Matt were talking about how they had really wasted their time and effort,
                    when trucks and boats started showing up and by 9 o’clock 47 teams had shown up to be a part of the 1st
                    gigging tournament.

                    John and Matt wanted to have a public fish fry on the second day of the tournament, they used the
                    fish that was gigged on the first night of the tournament and 100 lbs of beans to feed everyone.
                    Both soon learned that they did not have near enough people cooking and needed more food to feed all
                    the people that showed up. The fish fry for the public is a tradition that is still continued today.

                    Some of the early rules made the tournament fun to watch.  The take-off was done by drawing a number
                    and getting all boats lined up against the bank with one man at the motor which was not allowed to
                    be running and the other man on the bank ready to push off.  A flare was shot and everyone had to
                    start their motor and the race was on. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO CRAZY...considering there were no motor
                    size restrictions and people were going all directions.  Eventually they moved to declaring which
                    direction the team was going to go and motors were limited to 15 hp.  This greatly improved the
                    take-off but it was still fun to watch for the occasional boat wreck and busted lights.

                    One of the biggest hurdles the early tournaments had to clear was the getting the permission to use
                    Lake Eucha and lobbying against a gigging season in Delaware County.  Lake Eucha is owned by the City
                    of Tulsa, therefore every year John Ward and then eventually the NGCGA had to request the use of Lake
                    Eucha for the Gigging Tournament. One of the things people still don’t realize is that the giggers
                    are responsible for picking up the trash and keeping the tournament area clean.  The tournament site
                    can be taken away if the area is not properly maintained.  The implementation of a gigging season was
                    also a threat to the tournament in the early years.  In the late 70’s and early 80’s the state wanted
                    to implement a gigging season.  We have one now that is currently in effect for the entire state from
                    December 1st to March 31st.  During this time, John Ward and several other NGCGA members went to the
                    State Capitol and lobbied against a statewide gigging season.  Their efforts were rewarded,
                    in Delaware
                    and Mayes counties gigging is now allowed all year long. One of the biggest reasons was because of the
                    large percentage of Cherokee and other Native Americans that rely on gigging to keep family and tribal
                    traditions alive.

                    The National Green Country Gigging Tournament is getting ready for its 46th year.  It would not be
                    possible if it weren’t for the hard work and dedication of so many over the years that have kept the
                    vision of John Ward and Matt Mathews alive.  It’s fun to look back at the old gigging tournaments and
                    see what has changed over the years and what has remained the same.  The boats are mostly the same,
                    but today most boats are light and vary between 1436 and 1448.  There are also a few really light
                    teams that use a 1236.  The motors and their accessories have changed quite a bit.  In the beginning,
                    there were motors of all sizes, today only 15 horsepower motors are allowed.  The biggest change for
                    motors was adding electric hydraulic tilt/trim to the boats & motors along with stainless steel cupped
                    props.  Lights also have seen huge changes over the years.  Propane lights were what everyone used in
                    the early years.  After that came 12 volt lights, then the biggest change was aided by electric
                    generators.  Boats were able to go to halogen lights, mercury vapors, high pressure sodium, and metal
                    halides.  Today most boats use LED lights that are extremely bright and use less wattage than other
                    lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The one thing that has remained constant is the people.  People still show up by the thousands to watch
                    take-off and weigh-in every year.  In the beginning most people stayed in tents and a select few had
                    campers.  Today there are a few tents but mostly it is campers and RV’s as far as the eye can see.
                    Most people getting there a week or two early so nobody else will get their favorite camping spot.
                    Some people are so committed they set their yearly vacation time around the gigging tournament and
                    others have even exchanged their wedding vows there.Not everyone who comes is a &ldquo;Gigger&rdquo;, but
                    hopefully all who come leave with an fun experience that they will never forget!That is why it all
                    began, and it is a big part of the reason it is still continuing today.
