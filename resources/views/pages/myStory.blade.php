               <p class="text-white text-left top-spacer-60">Back in 1998
                   I had lost one of my best gigs in Elk River. It broke off
                  the handle and we could not find it after looking for almost an hour.  I had several other gigs that
                  I inherited from my dad but they were pretty worn out from many years of use and in need of some
                  repair.  Most of them were identified by the name of the people that had made them: Scroggins, Sissom,
                  Webb, Botts. These were common names if you grew up around Delaware County in Northeastern Oklahoma
                  and spent time gigging at Lake Eucha, Low Water, or Drowning Creek.  However, when I tried to go and
                  buy a gig, I found that it was easier said than done.  Clarence Scroggins and Bill Sissom quit making
                  gigs in the late 80s-early 90s, Jesse Webb still made a few of them but he was busy with other jobs
                  and only made them for a short time each year, and Tilford Botts lived in Colcord and I had no idea
                  how to find him.  I loved gigging, I had been going since I could walk and went every chance I got.
                  I couldn’t imagine not being able to go because I didn’t have a good gig.<br>
               <br>
               When I was in my early twenties I had helped my cousin build a couple gigs that ended up winning the
                  <a class="text-secondary underline" href="/tournament">National Gigging Tournament</a> for us.  I started
                  thinking about how awesome it would be if I could build a gig myself.  I had some welding experience
                  so I created a gig design I liked.  However, I had no idea where to begin on making the ferrule and
                  attaching it to the gig.  I knew there was basically one person I could talk to who could tell me
                  everything I needed to know, so I drove to Jesse Webb's house and luckily he was home.  I knew who he
                  was and he knew who I was because of my dad but I had never really actually spoken to him.  Jesse was
                  very nice, he invited me into his shop and began answering every question I had about making gigs and
                  tempering them.  I left that night confident I could make a good gig!<br>
               <br>
               Over the next couple of years I made about 25 gigs out of about any type of spring steel I could find.
                  My earliest gigs were made out old plow points. They were really good gigs but they took a while to
                  make because I had to cut and grind the outsides of the gig also.  Nowadays I make them all out of
                  5160 Spring Steel. <a class="text-secondary underline" href="/facts">Greg Wilson</a> owns most of the
                  first gigs I made. If anyone gets any credit for helping my gig making career take off it would have
                  to go to him. He was one of the first people to buy my gigs and tell other people about them.  Greg
                  and his brother <a class="text-secondary underline" href="/facts">Steve Wilson</a> won 4 consecutive
                  National Gigging Titles with my gigs in the early 2000s. That is when people began to notice more and
                  more that my gigs held fish well and were built to last.  <br>
               <br>
               Since 1998 I have made over 500 gigs in many different sizes and shapes, from 1" crawdad gigs to
                  5 ¼" Spoonbill/Carp gigs and everything in between.  I’m sure there are several lost to the creeks and
                  lakes in which they are used but almost all of them are still in use today.  I still make them all by
                  hand in the same shop almost the same way I did in the beginning. The only difference is I use a new
                  welder and I&#8217;ve learned a few things that save a little bit of time when making them.  Each gig takes
                  about 2 hours to make and I take great pride in building each one.  I think if you take the time to
                  pick one up you will be quite happy you did.<br>
